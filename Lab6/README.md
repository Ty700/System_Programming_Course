Your task now is to complete the provided mcomplex.py script. Here, you must now define the
behavior of the * and / operators to do the operations that have already been documented in the
script.
Furthermore, the complex class should also support a new data attribute distance (d), which can be
calculated via the Pythagorean theorem as follows:
𝑑 = √𝑟2 + 𝑖2
Therefore, by using d you should be able to override the > and < operators to compare the “magnitude”
of two complex numbers.
